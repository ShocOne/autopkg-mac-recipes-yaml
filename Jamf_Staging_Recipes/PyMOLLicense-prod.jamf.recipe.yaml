Description: Uploads the pkg to the JSS, and creates a Self-Service Policy available to members of a Testing group.
Comment: this policy does not need to be staged; this recipe is only for reporting purposes. The SELFSERVICE_POLICY_NAME key does not create a self-service policy - this is only so that the Slack and SharePoint reporting will work properly.
